- Habit tracking: Enable users to add, edit, and delete habits.
- Reminders: Set reminders for daily habit tracking.

## Notifications
- Push notifications for reminders and updates on user progress.

## AI/ML
- Implement machine learning algorithms to suggest habits based on user behavior.
- Analyze user data to offer personalized insights.

## Progress Visualization
- Use charts and graphs to display user progress and habit completion rates.

## Optional Integrations
- Integration with third-party services like calendars and health apps for a comprehensive experience.

## Testing
- Conduct unit tests for individual components.
- Perform user testing to gather feedback and improve usability.

## Polish
- Finalize UI enhancements, fix bugs, and optimize performance.
